# Android Note App
I developed a Android Note app that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes easily. I used several advanced technologies to ensure that the app is easy to use and that user notes are stored securely.

# Libraries used

### MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
I used the MVVM architecture to organize the app's code. This means that the business logic is separated from the user interface, making maintenance and testing easier. The ViewModel is the intermediate layer that 
communicates with the database and other data sources, while the View is the user interface that is updated based on changes in the ViewModel.

### Room Database
I used the Room Database to store user notes. Room is a Jetpack library that allows for efficient and easy creation and management of SQLite databases. With Room, I was able to define the database entities and tables in an object modeling language (ORM) instead of manually writing SQL code.

### Dagger
I used Dagger to inject dependencies into the app in secure way.

### Composable Navigation
Finally, I used composable navigation. Composable Navigation is a modern approach to navigate between different screens in Jetpack Compose applications.
